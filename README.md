# techdegree-project5
 This is the fifth project assigned for Treehouse's JavaScript Techdegree Program.

 For this project, we'll build an app for a fictional company called **Awesome Startup**, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

 We’ll use the [Random User Generator API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees”, and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

 We’ll request a **JSON** *object* from the **API** and parse the data so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location. Clicking the employee’s image or name will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
